# Econometrics

## Problem Set #1 
In this problem set, the programming software of R is utilized to create simple linear regression models to evaluate data sets. By working through these problems, I've learned statistically how the regression function is found and how their coefficients can be brought into context in an economcs context. In addition, the logirithmic version of terms are utilized to show percentage effects.

## Problem Set #2
In this problem set, simplear linear regression with one variable is turned into multiple linear regression to assess multiple explanatory variables. Again, the programming langauage of R is utilized.
